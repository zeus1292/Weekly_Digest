I want to build a web application called ResearchLens that helps users stay up to date with recent academic papers in a personalized and structured way. The main goal of this app is to let users input a topic they’re curious about (like "Agentic AI") and receive a weekly digest of around 5 to 10 research papers related to that topic, sourced from arXiv. These papers should be summarized using an LLM like GPT, and the summaries should be structured clearly—highlighting the paper’s core problem, proposed solution, limitations or challenges, and why it matters in practical terms. The summaries should be concise, accurate, and helpful for someone who doesn’t have time to read full research papers but still wants to stay informed.
The user interface should start with a simple input field where users can enter a research topic and optionally add keywords or choose a subdomain (like NLP or Robotics). Once they click “Generate Weekly Digest,” the backend should fetch recent arXiv papers in relevant categories (starting with CS.AI and CS.LG), filter them based on the topic or keywords, and pass the abstracts or full text through an AI summarizer. The result should be a clean display of summaries in card format, each showing the title of the paper, a structured summary, a link to the paper, and optional actions like bookmarking or giving a thumbs up/down for feedback. I also want to store user preferences or recent topics using localStorage (or a simple backend database) so the app can personalize future digests.
The tech stack can be React and TailwindCSS on the frontend, with Flask or FastAPI on the backend. For the AI, we can use OpenAI’s API directly or through LangChain with prompt templates. I’m open to adding enhancements like exporting to Notion or Slack, integrating citation counts from Semantic Scholar, or detecting novel or cutting-edge ideas from the papers.
Please help me get started by building a basic working prototype that focuses on the weekly digest flow and structured summarization, using arXiv as the initial data source.
